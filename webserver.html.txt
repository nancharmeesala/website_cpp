<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello, World!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>

This HTML file contains a <h1> element that displays the "Hello, World!" message.

Now, run your C++ server code (the one I provided earlier).

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:8080 (assuming your server is running on port 8080). You should see the "Hello, World!" message displayed on the webpage.

That's it! Your C++ server is now serving a basic HTML webpage with the "Hello, World!" message. You can expand and customize the HTML content to create more complex webpages.
